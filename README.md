# NewsWave-News App

NewsWave, my latest web project, blends React and NewsAPI for a personalized news experience. Explore diverse categories, enjoy seamless responsiveness, and read comfortably day or night with dark mode. Effortless news browsing is facilitated by infinite scroll. Challenges in integrating these features provided valuable learning experiences, enhancing my skills in state management and asynchronous operations in React. While not for public release, NewsWave reflects my commitment to growth in web development. Feedback is appreciated, and collaboration opportunities are welcome on this dynamic coding journey! 🚀
